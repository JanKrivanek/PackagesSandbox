## <a name="65"></a>65 - Invalid, corrupted or unexpected data

The buildlink.json or pointed nuget package have some unexpected or corrupted data.

This is a semi-standardized exit code (see [EX_DATAERR in /usr/include/sysexits.h](https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/master/include/sysexits.h#L102))


## <a name="70"></a>70 - Unexpected internal software issue

Unexpected result or issue. [File a bug](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/issues/new?title=Unexpected%20Internal%20Software%20Issue%20(EX_SOFTWARE)) if you encounter this exit code.

This is a semi-standardized exit code (see [EX_SOFTWARE in /usr/include/sysexits.h](https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/master/include/sysexits.h#L107))


## <a name="73"></a>73 - Can't create output file.

The operation was cancelled due to detection of an attempt to perform destructive changes to existing files. This can happen if you are attempting to use existing source repository with pending changes, or write over existing buildlink.json.

Destructive changes can be forced by passing `--force` option.

This is a semi-standardized exit code (see [EX_CANTCREAT in /usr/include/sysexits.h](https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/master/include/sysexits.h#L110))


## <a name="102"></a>102 - Missing required option(s) and/or argument(s) for the command

_Reserved for future usage - described behavior is only partially implemented. Some cases that should fall under this exit code are now leading to code [127](#127).


## <a name="107"></a><a name="108"></a><a name="109"></a><a name="110"></a><a name="111"></a><a name="112"></a><a name="113"></a>107 - 113

## <a name="127"></a>127 - Unrecognized option(s) and/or argument(s) for a command

The exit code is used when one or more options or/and arguments used in the command not recognized or invalid. 

This is a semi-standardized exit code (see [127 - "command not found" in 'The Linux Documentation Project'](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html))


## <a name="130"></a>130 - Command terminated by user.

The exit code is used if command is terminated after user non-forceful termination request (e.g. `Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-Break`).
